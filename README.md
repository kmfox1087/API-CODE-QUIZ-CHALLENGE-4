## Description

For Bootcamps 4th challenge, we had to make a JavaScript quiz. This allowed us to use the JavaScript we've been learning 
and put our skills to the test to make a fun game with a timer and highscore board! 

## User Story

* AS A coding boot camp student
* I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
* SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Acceptance Criteria

* GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
* WHEN I click the start button
* THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
* WHEN I answer a question
* THEN I am presented with another question
* WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
* THEN time is subtracted from the clock
* WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
* THEN the game is over
* WHEN the game is over
* THEN I can save my initials and my score

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Go to git@github.com:kmfox1087/API-CODE-QUIZ-CHALLENGE-4.git and copy SSH
